# Web Server Documentation

Group: A1
Author: Siarhei Pushkin

## Results and Conclusions

### What I Learned

Completing this assignment deepened my understanding of developing a server-side application in Java. I learned about handling HTTP requests and responses, including parsing request headers, processing different HTTP methods, and generating appropriate responses. Additionally, I learned about the importance of error handling and how to manage exceptions that can occur in server applications, such as handling "file not found" errors or permission issues.

### Challenges I Encountered

While completing this assignment, one of the main challenges I encountered was ensuring that the server responses were correctly formatted and contained the expected content. This involved carefully managing the response headers, and ensuring the response body matched the expected content. Additionally, handling file paths and ensuring that the server could access the necessary files posed a challenge, especially when dealing with scripts that needed to be executed. To overcome these challenges, I tried to carefully review the requirements for each response type, debugged any issues with file paths or permissions, and tested the server responses. While I implemented various response writers and associated tests in the server project, the server's overall functionality still needs additional work. Despite the progress in handling different response scenarios, issues remain, particularly regarding file execution and proper handling of script responses. Further debugging and refinement are needed to achieve full functionality.
